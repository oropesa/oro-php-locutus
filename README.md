# Oro Php Locutus

[Locutus](https://locutus.io/php/) is a project that seeks to assimilate other languagesâ€™ standard libraries to JavaScript.

Locutus is a huge library created by a community effort, so instead of downloading all their code, this is just a piece of it.

```shell
npm install oro-php-locutus
```

Methods:
```js
serialize()

unserialize()

utf8Encode()

utf8Decode()

htmlspecialchars()

md5()
```
